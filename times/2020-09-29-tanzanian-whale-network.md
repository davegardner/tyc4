The Tanzanian Whale Network is an informal group of people who are frequently on the ocean in Tanzania and who report sightings of humpback whales. A WhatsApp group provides realtime sightings, and the data reports are consolidated to provide a picture of whale numbers at various times and places along the coast. The group encourages everyone who is regularly on the water to join, including fishermen, sailors and boaties of all sorts.


## Humpback whales

Humpback whales (*Megaptera novaeangliae*) are present in Tanzanian waters from June to November each year. They spend the austral summer months (Nov-March) in Antarctica feeding and make the long migration to give birth and mate in the relatively safe, warm tropical waters of East Africa. Now that whale hunting has largely ceased, humpback whale populations in East Africa are believed to be steadily increasing in number, and, as a consequence, humpback whale sightings in Tanzania and other nearby regions are becoming more common.

## Membership

Members include most of the divers, recreational fishermen, sailors and water sports operators in the country. Also included are some of the marine park managers, marine biologists, conservationists, and fisheries specialists etc. Members live across the entire country, but there are large numbers from Mafia, Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam and fewer from Tanga and Mtwara/Lindi. Anyone can be a member &ndash; all you need is a willingness to report the whales you see.

See [Links](#Links) below for details.

## Communications

The Tanzania Whale Network currently communicates whale sightings via a whatsapp group. To join the whatsapp group, please get in touch. There is also an online form for logging sightings and photos. Requests for people to report whale sightings on the online
form were placed on prominent Facebook Groups: Team Tanzania and Zanzibar Residents.

## 2019 Report

In 2019 a total of 27 whale sightings were reported, which comprised a total of 47 individual whales and included 3 calves. One
