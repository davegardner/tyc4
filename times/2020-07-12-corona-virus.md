Currently there are no restrictions on entering or leaving Tanzania. You can [clear in](/times/clearing-in/) without quarantine and clear out when you want to.

Visas are being extended for yachts currently here, but there are no guarantees that such extensions will be granted in future.

Hand-washing before entering any premises is heavily encouraged, and masks are worn in some places. Social distancing is practiced.
