There's nothing sweeter than kids, plonked in optimists, sailing around the bay like little ducks.  We're doing it here once a month and all are welcome.  The kids absolutely love it.

Those who know the ropes can take a boat out alone, anyone who has never sailed before can go with an adult and receive some expert tuition.  Optimists are so easy and fun to sail they're a great way for kids to learn.  

We send them out with a safety boat, which is also doubles as a photo boat, and afterwards we meet in the bar for a spot of lunch.
