Tanga Signal Station maintains a 24-hour watch.  On entering Tanga Bay contact Tanga Signal on channel VHF 12 or 16, although, full disclosure, this can be a fruitless task. 

Having anchored up outside the yacht club you are to stay on board until Port Health have visited you.  They will row out to your boat for a quick check.  

For Immigration you will need a valid passport.  Visas can be obtained from Immigration for a fee.  Fee structure depends on your nationality.  Often they will come to the bar to meet you, stamp in hand.  All visas to be paid in dollars if possible.  

To arrange Port Health and Immigration you can email Mercy (the office manager) in advance or, if you are able, call her once you arrive.  She will alert them both to your arrival.  

Mercy's number: +255 715 766 706

Customs formalities are then completed at the office on Dhow Wharf, beyond the commercial wharf.  They are open between 0800 hrs until 1600 hrs, five days a week.  You will need Clearance Papers from your last country of departure and a crew list for Customs.

Transire: If you have already checked into Tanzania, a Transire from your last Tanzanian port is required by Customs although recent reports suggest that this is seldom enforced.  If you have already cleared into Tanzania, checking in with Immigration is not required.

As this is a marine park itâ€™s necessary to pay a small fee to the Harbour.  The yearly cost is $5 per meter, and the yacht club will arrange this for you.
