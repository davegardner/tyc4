The Yacht Club is convenient to town and there is a good local transport system based on bikes, buses and 3-wheeled tuk tuks. Beyond that, your options are somewhat more limited.

### Walk

The Yacht Club is about 3km from town. It's an easy walk, and with your backpack and bags full you can catch a lift back to the club on a piki piki (motorbike, no helmet available or required for passengers). If the driver doesn't understand 'Yacht Club' as a destination, try 'Raskazone', the name of the suburb.

It is a short walk to the end of the peninsula where there are benches at the lookout point.

### Pikipiki and Boda Boda

A *pikipiki* is a motorcycle and motorcycle taxis are known as *boda boda*. They are cheap &mdash; about TSH2000 (less than $2) one way between club and town.

### Tuktuk/Bajaj

These three-wheeled carriers are everywhere and great for a couple or when you have a lot to carry.

### Daladala

Just flag down one of these brightly sign-painted small busses, hop on, pay your TSH400 and tell them when you want to get off.

### Buses

For longer distances buses are the main transport. They are inexpensive and comfortable.

### Flying

Tanga is serviced by two airlines flying light planes such as Cesna Caravans. You can access Arusha, Pemba, Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam. Flights are relatively expensive and flying Tanga to Dar es Salaam will cost you about $200.
