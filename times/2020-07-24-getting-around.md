The Yacht Club is convenient to town and there is a good local transport system based on bikes, buses and 3-wheeled tuk tuks. Beyond that, your options are somewhat more limited.

### Walk

The Yacht Club is about 3km from town. It's an easy walk, and with your backpack and bags full you can catch a lift back to the club on a piki piki (motorbike, no helmet required for passengers). If the driver doesn't understand 'Yacht Club' as a destination, try 'Raskazone', the name of the suburb.

The walk out to the end of the peninsula is pleasant with benches at the lookout point.

### Pikipiki and Boda Boda

A *pikipiki* is a motorcycle and motorcycle taxis are known as *boda boda*. They are cheap &mdash; about TSH2000, less than $2, one way from club to town.

### Tuktuk/Bajaj

These three-wheeled carriers are everywhere and great for a couple or when you have a lot to carry.

### Daladala

These are small busses that are very cheap and available on all major routes in and out of town. Just flag one down, hop on, pay your TSH400 and tell them when you want to get off.

### Buses

For longer distances buses are the main transport. 

### Flying

Tanga is services by two airlines flying light planes such as Cesna Caravans. You can access Arusha, Pemba, Zazibar and Dar es Salaam. Flights are expensive and Tanga to Dar es Salaam will cost you about $200.
