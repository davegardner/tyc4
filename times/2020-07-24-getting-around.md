The Yacht Club is convenient to town and there is a good local transport system based on bikes, buses and 3-wheeled tuk tuks. Beyond that, your options are somewhat more limited.

> The Yacht Club is about 3km from town. It's an easy walk, and with your backpack and bags full you can catch a lift back to the club on a piki piki (motorbike, no helmet required  for passengers).
