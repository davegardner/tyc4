Our dear friends on Twende tied the knot last weekend, and there was no way we weren't going to throw them a bash to celebrate.  So we did, and it was awesome. 

Fearing a fouled prop we stopped short of tying tin cans to the back of their dinghy, but with decorations, a cake and the Macarena we had all other bases covered. 

We partied into the early hours, recovering with an impromptu brunch the next day.

General consensus was we love weddings, they're great fun, so we're now on the prowl for our next victims (renewing of the vows works too) .....anyone?
