### Water

Available at the club for free, included as part of your membership.

### Supermarkets

Mkwabi:  Situated on the right hand side as soon as you arrive in town, opposite Exim bank.  Sells bread and has a lot of marmite which the Brits will appreciate.

SD supermarket:  Opposite the fresh produce market is a cavernous supermarket that sells basically everything, including booze.  

Central Bakery:  Don’t let the name, or its size, deceive you. Its shelves are teeming with food and household items.  Additionally there’s a warm food counter which has all sorts of breads, pastries, samosas, sausage rolls even.  It sells the best bread. 

### Produce Markets

Just ask the bejaji (tuk tuk) or pikipiki (motorbike) to take you to the “sarconi” (market) and they’ll drop at the closest fresh produce market, known affectionately as the “muzungu market”, right in the centre of town.  The deliveries of food for this market seem to be on Tuesday evenings so Wednesday is the best day to go when everything is freshest.  It’s a fabulous market with vegetables, fruit, dried beans, rice, eggs, spices, cooking oils, sugar, flour, as well as many household items and even gifts, clothes, sandals and fridge magnets.  There are several good quality butchers there too. 

There is a second market located slightly further away, on the other side of the large clothes market “tango mano”.  Locals tend to favour this one more as prices are more affordable, although as a “muzungu” it’s hard to say whether this would apply. 

Fish Market:  There’s an excellent fish market where you can buy, inexpensively, all your seafood. 

### Clothes / everything else market

This is called Tango Mano and it’s huge.  It’s where you go for your clothes, flip flops, bags, hats … all the stuff you need to keep replacing because the sun has f***** it up.  Interestingly, you might find yourself buying a t-shirt that you donated to Oxfam once upon a time - because this is where all those donations come, in giant bales. 

### Fuel 

Petrol and Diesel: Several petrol stations in town with diesel.  Kerosene is also available at some (but not all).  

LPG:  No refills but exchange bottles readily available. Probably need to buy a regulator and connect it yourself.

### Money

ATMs:  There are many banks with ATMs scattered around town, accessing money is easy. 

Credit Cards:  All major credit cards are accepted in places like supermarkets and hotels but for markets etc, it’s cash only.

Currency Exchange:  You can exchange money at banks like Exim without needing an account there, and it’s an easy process. 

Exchange Rate:  As at July 2020
10,000 Tsh is roughly   4.30 USD  /  73.30 ZAR  /   6.20 AUD  /   3.80  EUR  /  3.40 GBP
		    
### Phones / SIM Cards

Tigo and Airtel are the main internet and phone providers.  You will need a passport to purchase a sim card.  

With Tigo, assuming you have a smartphone and credit on your account, you can top up your phone and / or dongle using their app, without having to go ashore.

### Transport

Getting into Tanga from the yacht club is easy.  It’s close enough to walk, or a couple of hundred meters up from the club it’s possible to grab a pikipiki (motorbike) for approximately 2000 Tsh or a dula dula (small bus) for 400 Tsh.  You may wish to come back from town with all your shopping in a bejaji (tuk tuk) which will cost around 4000 Tsh.  There are also taxis available. 

Goodluck tuktuk: 

If you would like someone to call to help you run errands you can call Charles (number) who speaks good English and would be happy to do your shopping / collect diesel etc and deliver it back to the yacht club. 


### Medical

The main public hospital in Tanga is called Bombo hospital although most cruisers prefer to use the private hospital, Safic hospital, which is situated almost directly opposite.  Safic is good for minor ailments and malaria, for anything serious it may be necessary to go to Dar es Salaam.

There is a pharmacy located just further up from both these hospitals and there is another well-stocked pharmacy in town called International Pharmacy.
