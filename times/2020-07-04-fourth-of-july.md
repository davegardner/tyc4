Not one, not two, but three brass bands played up and down the street outside the yacht clud. All day it went on. Was it really a 4th July celebration? Am I in the right country?  Well, yes and no. It was a local wedding! Daz rushed upstairs to get a pic but the truck had passed before he got to the bottom of the stairs. He turned and started coming back just as a *second* truck arrived. He made a brief attempt to catch it before realizing he wasn't going to make that one either and again turned back to us just as I started to hear a *third* truck approaching. He wouldn't have made that either as he was standing in the same place he gave up when trying to catch the first truck. The lesson is: don't dither at a big wedding &ndash; if at first you do not succeed try, try again.

This week the mullahs have turned up the loud hailer volume at the local mosque and we've all been getting an earful from 0500 to 2100, sometimes later. They sound such a miserable lot. I cannot help but feel sorry for them. There is no peace in their message. It is all suffering and god bothering. This morning they have a nasally guy who *can* actually sing, but he sounds so mournful. What a dreadful way to greet the day. 

The sky is dark and there may be some cloud. Yesterday we had a fair bit of thin cloud in the morning &mdash; enough to significantly cut the solar and so I ran the engine for 2 hours and the watermaker for 3 hours. The sun did improve after midday, enough to run the watermaker for a while. But the batteries are now over four years old and rather tired. I no longer run the fridge at night, which eases the load and makes it possible to get through the night, but I really need to fork out for a new set.
