Kiswahili is a Bantu language spoken throughout Tanzania and Kenya. Phonetically, it is a simple language and relatively easy for English-speakers to acquire. The difficulty in learning Swahili is that, because it isn't a Latin language, there is no overlap with English. 

Still, you already know at least one Swahili word: *safari* which simply means journey in English.
